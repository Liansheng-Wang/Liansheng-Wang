- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Liansheng-Wang, a PhD candidate at the East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST), specializing in SLAM, robotics, and machine learning.

- ðŸ”­ My research focuses on developing novel approaches in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), reinforcement learning, and multi-robot systems. I am particularly interested in advancing real-time robotics systems with high precision and scalability.

- ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m currently working on multi-robot path planning and control algorithms, aiming to improve the coordination and decision-making efficiency in dynamic environments.

- ðŸŒ± In my free time, I explore the latest advancements in reinforcement learning, planning algorithms, and their integration with robotics.
